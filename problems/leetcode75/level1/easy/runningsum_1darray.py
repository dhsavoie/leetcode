1480. Running Sum of 1d Array

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

time complexity: O(n)
    - iterates through the list once so the time is proportional to the length of the list
    - got a run time of 40 ms, which beats 73.61% of users


space complexity: O(n)
    - creates a new list that is the same length as the input list
    - got a memory usage of 14.1 MB, which beats 18.55% of users
